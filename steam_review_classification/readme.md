# Text Classification with Machine Learning 🚀

Welcome to this machine learning project that explores text classification using various models and vectorization techniques. This repository demonstrates a robust pipeline for processing textual data and applying machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify textual data into categories (e.g., Positive/Negative) using:

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Transform text data into numerical form.

- Machine Learning Models: Explore multiple models such as:
    - Random Forest Classifier 🌲
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM) ⚙️
    - Naive Bayes 🤓

> Key features include preprocessing, feature engineering, and detailed performance evaluation.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🛠️ Workflow

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords.
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
  - Model Training:
  - Train various models and fine-tune hyperparameters.

- Evaluation:
-   Assess models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

- Sample Predictions:
  - Visualize predictions on random text samples.

## 📊 Key Steps in the Notebook

### Import Libraries:

`import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`

### TF-IDF Vectorization:

`tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(sampled_data['cleaned_content'])`

### Model Training and Evaluation:

`evaluate_model(rf, X_tfidf_train, X_tfidf_test, y_train_tfidf, y_test_tfidf, "Random Forest", "TF-IDF")`

### Visualize Confusion Matrix:

`sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')`

## 🏆 Results

The project provides:

- Confusion matrices for better insights into model performance.
- Sample predictions for validation.

## 🌟 Future Work

- Incorporating deep learning models like LSTMs or BERT for improved accuracy.
- Adding more datasets to generalize the models.
- Implementing a web interface for real-time predictions.
