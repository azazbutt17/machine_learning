## ðŸ”¥ Upgraded Version: Deep Learning with LSTMs

We have extended this project by integrating deep learning models, specifically LSTMs, for improved performance on text classification tasks. This version leverages recurrent neural networks to better capture sequential patterns in text data.

- **Key Features**:
  - Utilizes embeddings for text input.
  - Trains an LSTM model for sentiment classification.
  - Compares the performance with traditional machine learning models.
